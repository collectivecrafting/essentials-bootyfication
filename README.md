# essentials-bootyfication

**Make the ever-so-popular essentials plugin ever-so-unpopular with ever-so-custom messages.**

## What do it do booboo?

It removes that SUPER ugly orange color, replacing it with light gray.. and replacing red with dark green! Hooray!

It also tones down those error messages and permission messages.. instead of "You don't have access error error error blah blah" it's now just "Access denied."

## But Khia, how do I install it?

Drop "messages_en.peroperties" into your essentials dir.

Edit your config.yml with ```lang: en```

bang up job done, ho ho ho merry christmas. <3
